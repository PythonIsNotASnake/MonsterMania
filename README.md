# MonsterMania
A Pokemon like game

# Technologies
For this project I used different technologies like XML with a DOM-Parser or TCP-Socket-Communication.
The settings for each player are in a XML-File. This file have values for your monster like attacks and healthpoints. Addditionally there is a path for the image of your monster.
This settings are shared with your opponent via a TCP-Connection. My implementation of this connection is a little bit ugly so if you work with this you can change this component or build a TCP-Server to manage this tasks.
